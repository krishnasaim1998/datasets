% Interesting notice: In this dataset laplace and coverage evaluation functions have better results
% than compression. That is because there are relatively few examples (only 560) and since the interesting
% hypothesis are relatively large (about 6 literals) the cost of the pos coverage - neg coverage -
% num literals in hypothesis can easily become negative because pos score - neg score is only slightly positive
% (e.g. 8-2). To overcome that, we set example inflation to a high value (e.g. 10, i.e. multiplying each
% example weight by 10). This way the pos score - neg score for the same hypothesis would be 60. If such
% an hypothesis had 10 literals it would before be discarded but now accepted.
